# My Resume
This project will walk you through the steps of hosting a resume as a website. In this example, we will write the file itself in the Markdown language, and utilize a program like HackMD as our Markdown editor. The file will be hosted on GitHub Pages, which uses Jekyll to convert your Markdown file into a nice-looking webpage. Your project should also try to incorporate ideas from Andrew Etter's book *Modern Technical Writing*.

## Getting Started
Hosting a resume on GitHub does not require you to download lots of complicated software. However, there are a few things you will need prior to starting this process.
#### Prerequisites 
* A resume written in Markdown
* A GitHub account https://github.com/
#### More Resources
* A tutorial on how to use Markdown https://www.markdowntutorial.com/
* Markdown editor: https://hackmd.io/
    * I like HackMD because it is online, but if that's not your thing, try downloading Atom instead https://atom.io/
* Jekyll download: https://jekyllrb.com/
    * Jekyll is built into GitHub so you do not need to download it for this project, but if you are interested in how exactly it works, I recommend trying to use it for hosting a webpage locally

## FAQ
*Why is Markdown better than a word processor?*  
Markdown is better to use than a word processor because it is simple to convert to HTML. Markdown is also a lot easier to learn, write, and read than HTML! This makes it your best choice for any formatted text that will be published online.


*Why is my resume not showing up?*  
There could be a few reasons why your resume is not showing up.
* Your GitHub account is not public
* Your resume file is not titled index.md
